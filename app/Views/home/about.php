        <h2>Why Choose These Technologies?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>JSON as a Database:</strong> 
                Using JSON for data storage is efficient for small to medium applications, allowing for easy data manipulation and faster performance compared to traditional databases.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Custom MVC Framework:</strong> 
                A custom framework allows for greater flexibility, performance optimizations, and a clear structure that fits the unique requirements of the app.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Asynchronous File Uploading:</strong> 
                The AsyncFileUploader enhances user experience by allowing multiple files to be uploaded without the need for page refreshes, providing instant feedback on upload progress.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            I highly recommend these technologies for anyone looking to develop efficient, user-friendly web applications. 
            Adopting a custom framework and utilizing JSON and asynchronous uploads will provide a solid foundation for a responsive, modern web experience.
